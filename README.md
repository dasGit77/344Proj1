This project is a basic search engine that retrieves data from the library of congress. It uses the [] API.

In addition to formatting and displaying the search results in a readable manner, a secondary function of this app is to store a local history of search results for the end user's searching convenience. 

The app uses an array to store the data and displays it in a fully scrollable CSS div that can be closed and opened at the user's convenience. Clicking on each <li> populates the search box with the term.
